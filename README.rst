Introduction
============
Delphini is a plugin for the Holland backup framework to generate backups of a
MySQL cluster.

Backups are generated by the following procedure:

 * Connect to the management node specified by ``connect-string`` and run
   START BACKUP WAIT COMPLETED
 * Lookup ndbd nodes from the configuration with ``ndb_config``
 * Copy the completed backup files from the BackupDataDir on each node
 * Ensure backups are available from at least one node per node-group
 * Purge old cluster backups on each node

ssh is used for connect to the data node servers and a tar stream is
piped to the backup-directory on the backup server where holland is running.

Delphini currently requires access via ssh using ssh keys to do the following:

 * Read the ``BackupDataDir`` files for the ``backup id`` initiated by the
   START BACKUP command
 * Remove the files in the ``BackupDataDir`` for the appropriate ``backup id``

Configuration
=============

::

  [mysql-cluster]
  connect-string 	= hostname # default: localhost
  default-ssh-user	= username # default: root
  default-ssh-keyfile	= keyfile  # default: no keyfile used

  [compression]
  method 	= gzip | bzip2 | lzop | pigz | pbzip2 | xz | lzma
  level 	= 0..9
  inline	= yes | no

The main section is the ``[mysql-cluster]`` section which defines
basic parameters for the cluster backups.  

TODO
====

  * Make the archival method configuration instead of hardcoding tar
  * Allow sudo execution of commands on remote server (probably
    by just making those command invocations configurable) - this
    will lift the restriction on direct ssh access to BackupDataDir
  * Backup mysql schema via mysqldump (triggers, stored routines, etc.)
