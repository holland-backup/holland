Introduction
============
This plugin contains all the plugins distributed by the core holland 
distribution. The backup plugins are all directly dependent on the
main holland distribution (located one level up from this directory).
The library plugins are typically self contained but usually
provide functionality directly applicable to the holland project
and are often dependencies of one or more backup plugins.

Plugin descriptions
===================

Here are brief descriptions of each of the plugins.  Please see the README
located under each plugin for more specific information or see documentation
at http://hollandbackup.org

holland.lib.common - General purpose functionality such as compression and 
                     archiving.

holland.lib.mysql  - Support for connections to a MySQL instance and generally
                     interacting with a deployment.

holland.lib.lvm    - A simple python API for interacting with LVM.  Primarily
                     designed to support LVM snapshots for the LVM based backup
                     plugins.


holland.backup.example      - A trivial example plugin that does nothing at all
                              but demonstrates the basic structure of a holland
                              backup plugin
holland.backup.mysqldump    - A mysqldump based backup plugin for MySQL
                              Depends: [holland.lib.common, holland.lib.mysql]

holland.backup.maatkit      - A wrapper around mk-parallel-dump.  Not really 
                              recommended for production quality backups. See
                              http://www.maatkit.org for more information on
