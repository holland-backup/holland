This plugin performs logical backups of a MySQL database by using the
mysqldump command.  Quite a few options are supported including database and
table filtering through inclusion/exclusion filtering directives.  Table
exclusions always map to --ignore-table parameters and database exclusions are
skipped by simply not passing them to the --database flags.

Inline-compression of mysqldump output is supported and the default.  By
default mechanism uses gzip -1 ("--fast") for fast but reasonable compression.
bzip2, pbzip2, lzop and lzma (vi xz-utils) are also supported.

For more information please consult the holland manual or visit the holland
wiki at http://hollandbackup.org.
