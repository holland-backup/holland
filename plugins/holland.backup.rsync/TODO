  * Ports feature does not work
    Running into an odd scaping issue that is making that difficult currently.

  * Estimate Backup Size busted
    How to calculate size for remote hosts (--dry-run?) and what about cases
    where --one-file-system is used? Plus the old way was expensive for large
    files/directories.
