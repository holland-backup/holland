This plugin acts as a front-end to facilitate both local and remote
backups of files and directories using rsync. Currently local copy,
as well as SSH and RSYNC remote methods are supported. Additionally,
hard-linking is supported across backups meaning that, if a file has
not changed since the last time Holland was run, a hardlink from the
previous backup is used instead of re-copying the file.
