MySQL LVM Provider Configuration [mysql-lvm]
============================================

Creates an LVM snapshot of a running MySQL instance and performs a 
binary-based backup with minimal locking. MySQL must be running on an
LVM volume with reserved space for snapshots. It is highly recommended
that this volume be separate from the one storing the resulting backups.

[mysql-lvm]
-----------

**snapshot-size** = <size-in-MB>

    The size of the snapshot itself. By default it is 20% of the size of  the 
    MySQL LVM mount or the remaining free-space in the Volume Group (if there 
    is less than 20% available) up to 15GB. If snapshot-size is defined, the 
    number represents the size of the snapshot in megabytes.

**snapshot-name** = <name>

    The name of the snapshot, the default being the name of the MySQL LVM 
    volume + "_snapshot" (ie Storage-MySQL_snapshot)
    
**snapshot-mountpoint** = <path>    
    
    Where to mount the snapshot. By default a randomly generated directory 
    under /tmp is used.

**innodb-recovery** = yes | no (default: no)

    Whether or not to run an InnoDB recovery operation. This avoids needing 
    to do so during a restore, though will make the backup process itself 
    take longer.

**force-innodb-backup** = yes | no (default: no)

    Whether to attempt a backup even if the mysql-lvm plugin thinks it cannot obtain a good
    backup.  This can occur when innodb data files are outside of the mysql datadir or exist
    on entirely separate logical volumes.

**lock-tables** = yes | no (default: yes)
    
    Whether or not to run a FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK to grab various
    bits of information (such as the binary log name and position). Disabling
    this requires that binary logging is disabled and InnoDB is being used
    exclusively. Otherwise, it is possible that the backup could contain
    crashed tables.
    
**extra-flush-tables** = yes | no (default: yes)
    
    Whether or not to run a FLUSH TABLES before running the full 
    FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK. Should make the FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK
    operation a bit faster.


[tar]
-----

**exclude** = pattern[, pattern...]

Patterns to exclude from archive.   These should be relative paths and are almost 
always relative to the mysql data directory.  For instance to exclude binary logs
in the data directory from the backup you might specify:
exclude = ./bin-log.*, mysql.sock

**pre-args** = <string>

Additional arguments to append to the tar commandline before the backup path is specified.
This should be the full string as you might specify on the commandline. Shell globbing is not
supported.  

For instance you
might add the /etc/my.cnf to the tar archive via:
pre-args = -C /etc ./my.cnf

**post-args** = <string>

Additional arguments to append to the tar commandline after the backup path is specified.
This should be a string exactly as you might specify on the commandline.  Shell globbing is not
evaluated.
