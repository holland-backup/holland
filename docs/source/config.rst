Holland Config Files
====================

By default, Holland's configuration files reside in /etc/holland. The main
configuration file is holland.conf, however there are a number of other 
configuration files for configuring default settings for providers and for
configuring backup sets.

Each configuration file has one ore more sections, defined by square
brackets Underneath each section, one or more configuration option
can be specified. These options are in a standard "option = value" format.
Comments are prefixed by the # sign.

Note that many settings have default values and, as a result, can either
be commented out or omitted entirely.

holland.conf - main config
--------------------------

The main configuration file (usually /etc/holland/holland.conf) defines
both global settings as well as the active backup sets. It is divided into
two sections :ref:`[holland]<holland-config>` and :ref:`[logging]<logging-config>`. 

.. _holland-config:

[holland]
^^^^^^^^^

.. describe:: plugin-dirs

    Defines where the plugins can be found. This can be a comma-separated 
    list but usually does not need to be modified.
    
.. _holland-config-backup_directory:    
    
.. describe:: backup_directory

    Top-level directory where backups are held. 
    
.. _holland-config-backupsets:

.. describe:: backupsets

    A comma-separated list of all the backup sets Holland should backup.
    Each backup set is defined in ``/etc/holland/backupsets/<name>.conf`` by
    default.
    
.. describe:: umask

    Sets the umask of the resulting backup files.
    
.. describe:: path

    Defines a path for holland and its spawned processes

.. _logging-config:
    
[logging]
^^^^^^^^^

.. describe:: filename

    The log file itself.

.. describe:: level

    Sets the verbosity of Holland's logging process. Available options are
    ``debug``, ``info``, ``warning``, ``error``, and ``critical``

Provider Configs
----------------

These files control the global settings / defaults for the providers used by 
the backup-sets. Many of these global settings can be overridden if defined
in a backup-set. Note that each provider's configuration file should begin
with ``[provider-name]``.

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    provider_configs/example
    provider_configs/mysqldump
    provider_configs/mysql-lvm
    provider_configs/mysqldump-lvm
    provider_configs/xtrabackup
    provider_configs/pgdump

Backup-Set Configs
------------------

Backup-Set configuration files largely inherit the configuration options of
the specified provider. To define a provider for the backup set, you must
put the following at the top of the backup set configuration file::

    [holland:backup]
    plugin = <plugin>
    backups-to-keep = #
    estimated-size-factor = #
    
**plugin** = <plugin>

    This is the name of the provider that will be used for the backup-set.
    This is required in order for the backup-set to function.

**backups-to-keep** = #

    Specifies the number of backups to keep for a backup-set. 
    Defaults to retaining 1 backup.
    
**estimated-size-factor** = #

    Specifies the scale factor when Holland decides if there is enough
    free space to perform a backup.  The default is 1.0 and this number
    is multiplied against what each individual plugin reports its 
    estimated backup size when Holland is verifying sufficient free
    space for the backupset.

**auto-purge-failures** = yes | no

    Specifies whether to keep a failed backup or to automatically remove
    the backup directory.  By default this is on with the intention that
    whatever process is calling holland will retry when a backup fails. 
    This behavior can be disabled by setting auto-purge-failures = no when
    partial backups might be useful or when troubleshooting a backup failure.

**purge-policy** = manual | before-backup | after-backup

    Specifies when to run the purge routine on a backupset.  By default this is
    run after a new successful backup completes.  Up to ``backups-to-keep``
    backups will be retained including the most recent.

    ``purge-policy`` = ``before-backup`` will run the purge routine just before
    a new backup starts.  This will retain up to ``backups-to-keep`` backups
    before the new backup is even started allowing purging all previous
    backups if ``backups-to-keep`` is set to 0.  This behavior is useful if
    some other process is retaining backups off-server and disk space is at a
    premium.

    ``purge-policy`` = manual will never run the purge routine automatically.
    Either ``holland purge`` must be run externally or an explicit removal of
    desired backup directories can be done at some later time.

**before-backup-command** = string

    Run a shell command before a backup starts.  This allows a command to 
    perform some action before the backup starts such as setting up an
    iptables rule (taking a mysql slave out of a load balancer) or aborting 
    the backup based on some external condition. 
    
    The backup will fail if this command exits with a non-zero status.

.. versionadded:: 1.0.7

**after-backup-command** = string

    Run a shell command after a backup completes.  This allows a command to 
    perform some action when a backup completes successfully such as sending
    out a success notification.
    
    The backup will fail if this command exits with a non-zero status.

.. versionadded:: 1.0.7

**failed-backup-command** = string

    Run a shell command if a backup starts.  This allows some command to 
    perform some action when a backup fails such as sending out a failure
    notification.

    The backup will fail if this command exits with a non-zero status.

.. versionadded:: 1.0.7

For all hook commands, Holland will perform simple text substitution  
on the three parameters:

  * hook - name of the hook being called (one of: before-backup-command, after-backup-command, failed-backup-command)
  * backupdir - path to the current backup directory (e.g. /var/spool/holland/mysqldump/YYYYmmdd_HHMMSS)
  * backupset - name of the backupset being run (e.g. 'mysql-lvm')

For example::
    
    [holland:backup]
    plugin = mysqldump
    before-backup-command = /usr/local/bin/my-custom-script --hook ${hook} --backupset ${backupset} --backupdir ${backupdir}
    after-backup-command = echo ${backupset} completed successfully.  Files are in ${backupdir}
    
    [mysqldump]
    ...


Backup-Set files are defined in the "backupsets" directory which is,
by default, ``/etc/holland/backupsets``. The name of the backup-set is 
defined by its configuration filename and can really be most anything. That
means backup-sets can be organized in any arbitrary way, although backup
set files must end in .conf. The file extension is not part of the name of
the backup-set.

As noted above, in order for a backup-set to be active, it must be listed in
the :ref:`backupsets<holland-config-backupsets>` variable.

Backups are placed under the directory defined in the 
:ref:`backup_directory<holland-config-backup_directory>`
section of the main configuration file. Each backup resides under a directory
corresponding to the backup-set name followed by a date-encoded directory.
