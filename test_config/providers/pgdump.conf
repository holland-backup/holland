[compression]
## compress method: gzip, bzip2 or lzop
## Which compression method to use, which can be either gzip, bzip2, or lzop.
## Note that lzop is not often installed by default on many Linux 
## distributions and may need to be installed separately.
method = gzip

## What compression level to use. Lower numbers mean faster compression, 
## though also generally a worse compression ratio. Generally, levels 1-3
## are considered fairly fast and still offer good compression for textual
## data. Levels above 7 can often cause a larger impact on the system due to
## needing much more CPU resources. Setting the level to 0 effectively 
## disables compresion.
level = 1
